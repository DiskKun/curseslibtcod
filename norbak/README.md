# The Fires of Norbak

version: 0.1

imports: curses (windows-curses on Windows), random, time

The file titled "main.py" is the source, and the file titled "Norbak" is an executable for MacOS only.

Space is the select key, rather than enter. Curses doesn't work well with the enter key, for some reason. The only exception to this is when you are inputing your name, here enter will work.
