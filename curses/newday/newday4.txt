It is a NEW DAY.
You are still asleep.
You are dreaming of your mother and father.
They are standing in front of you in your dream.
They are facing each other in your dream.
They are talking to each other in your dream.
You can not hear what they are saying in your dream.
Your PARENTS look at you in your dream.
They give you a look of disappointment in your dream.
This displeases you.
You greet your parents in your dream.
They disintegrate.
You are falling.
Until this moment, you were sure that you were dreaming.
Everything around you is dark.
You can only see yourself.
Your descent begins to slow.
You are now suspended in air.
You wish you could see.
A large, BLUE BUTTON appears.
The button reads "Push Me"
You feel a strong compulsion to press the button.
You feel like it is taboo to do so.
Secretly, this makes you want to push it even more.
You reach out to the button.
You were unable to touch it.
You awake in a sweat.
You were dreaming.
You do not know why you were so sure that you were not.
Thinking back, you think it was very silly.
Your mother is calling you.
You should probably get our of bed.

You are out of bed.
You put some clothes on.
You go see your mother.

You are in the kitchen.
You know what she is going to say.
She says you are going to be late for work.
You know.
You make yourself some breakfast.
You leave the house.
You drive to work.

You are at work.
You are told that your boss wants to see you.
That can not be good.
You go to your boss' office.

You are in your boss' office.
Your boss is not pleased.
She says that she has warned you multiple times.
She says that you are fired.
You do not really care.
She tells you to take anything you might have and leave.
You only ever brought yourself to work.
You leave work.
You drive home.

You are home.
Your mother asks you why you are home early.
You ignore her.
You go to your room.
Your feel that your life is difficult right now.
You can not be bothered right now.

You are in your room.
You lie down on your bed.
Your mind begins to think about your friends.
You have not seen them in a long time.
You wonder why that is.
Maybe it is because you do not think about them often.
You wish your friends were here.
You feel unimportant without them.
Maybe your father can be your friend.
It would be difficult, since he is so real.
But it might be worth it.
You do not give it any more thought.
You fall asleep.

You did not dream.

You wake up.
You are not in your bed.
This alarms you.
You sit up.
You are on the floor.
You are in a dark room.
You let your eyes adjust.

Your eyes have adjusted.
You are in your living room.
Your father is here.
This room has no doors.
Your father is looking at you.
You greet him.
He does not seem pleased.
He asks why you were sleeping on the floor.
You tell him that you fell asleep upstairs.
He reminds you that you have not been known to sleepwalk.
You remember that you have not been known to sleepwalk.
This concerns you.
You stand up.
You ask to leave.
Your request has been granted.
You leave through the room's doors.

You are in the hallway.
You approach the basement door.
You reach for the handle.

Your mother is calling you.
You go see your mother.

You are in your room.
Your mother is here.
She asks if you want to talk.
You ask what she is talking about.
She says that you have been acting strange lately.
You tell her that you have not noticed.
You know exactly what she is talking about.
She asks if you want to see your friends.
You are scared.
You wonder how she knows about your friends.
You are scared.
She says that you will not be able to see them again.
You are scared.
She says that you need to make new friends.
You leave your room.

You leave your house.
You get in your car.
You drive.

You have been driving for a number of hours.
Your GAS TANK is getting low.
You pull up at a RESTAURANT.
This place is a CAFE.
This place welcomes you.
It is warm here.
You seat yourself.

A WAITRESS appears.
Her clothing catches your eye.
She asks you if you would like anything to eat or drink.
You are not sure what is available.
You ask for a menu.
The waitress leaves.

The waitress returns.
She has brought you a menu.
She tells you to call her over when you decide.
You look at the menu.

You have been doing this for quite some time now.
You look to the clock.
The time reads 4:30 PM.
It is getting late.
The cafe will close soon.
You call the waitress.
The waitress is here.
You tell her that you would like to have a CUP OF COFFEE TO GO.
The waitress looks at you.
You can not tell whether or not the look is of attraction or disappointment.
You know it is one of the two.
The waitress leaves.

The waitress has returned with a cup of coffee to go.
You pay for the coffee.
You leave the cafe.

You drive home.

You are home.
You go to your room.

You are in your room.
You change into nightwear.
You enter your bed.
You turn off your lights.

You fall asleep.

You are dreaming about the waitress.

You like this dream for its simplicity.

Your alarm clock goes off.
You wake up.
You look to your clock.
The time reads...
There is no clock.
In any case, it is a NEW DAY.
