It is a NEW DAY.
You are in your bed.
Your mother is calling you.
You should probably get out of bed.

You are still in bed.
You can hear FOOTSTEPS approaching your room.
Your heart begins to beat faster.
Your DOOR opens.
Your mother enters your room.
She tells you to get up.
She says you will be late for work.
You remember you have work today.
Your mother turns on the light.
You sit up.
Your mother leaves the room.
You get out of bed.
You put some clothes on.
You leave your room.

You are in the kitchen.
You make yourself some breakfast.
You leave the house. 
You drive to work.

You are at work.
You are told that your boss wants to see you.
That can not be good.
You go to your boss' office.

Your boss is not pleased.
She says that this is your final warning.
She says she has plenty of applicants waiting to fill your spot.
This is noted.
You could not care any less.
You leave the office.

You get to work.

Nothing interesting happened at work today.
You leave work.
You drive home.

You are home.
Your mother is relieved you are home.
She asks you how your day was.
You tell her that your day was like any other.
She smiles.
You smile back.
You are wondering if your father is home.
You ask your mother if your father is home.
She says that he is not home, and will not be until tomorrow night.
You have mixed feelings about this.
Your mother says that tonight you will make yourself dinner.
She says you can have CEREAL.
She says you can have NOODLES.
She says you can have whatever you want.
You do not want anything.
You go to your room.

You are in your room.
You sit on your bed.
You look to your BOOKSHELF.
You want to read a new book.
You pull a book off of the shelf.
The book is called "Here we are, my friends"
Your FRIEND lent this book to you a number of years ago.
You have not returned the book.
You are no longer friends.
You read the book.

You are done reading the book.
It was GARBAGE.
You wonder why you bother with books.
You are hungry.
You do not want anything.
You lie down in bed.

You fall asleep.

You dream of people you like.
They do funny things in your dream.
You blush in your dream.
This dream makes you feel warm inside.
You dream of your GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.
This displeases you.
You awake in a sweat.
You look at your clock.
The time reads 5:00 PM.
You are very hungry.
You are thirsty.
You leave your room.

You are in the kitchen.
You pour yourself a glass of water.
You sip your water.
It tastes of gasoline.
Something is very wrong.
You spit out your water.
You smell your water.
It smells of water.
Maybe you imagined it.
You sip your water.
It tastes of fish and glass.
You have finished drinking.
It feels good to have something in your stomach.
You are still hungry.
You leave the kitchen.

You are in your room.
You feel like you are starving.
You wonder why you do this to yourself.
You leave your room.

You are in the kitchen.
You pour yourself a BOWL of cereal.
You eat your cereal.
You are done with your cereal.
Your hunger has been temporarily sated.
You leave the kitchen.

You are in the LIVING ROOM.
This place occasionally haunts you.
It may have something to do with the lack of lighting.
You are feeling dark.
This place does not haunt you at the moment.
You sit in a comfortable ARMCHAIR.
You BROOD for a few moments.

You are done brooding.
It was a real downer.
You look at the clock.
The time reads 8:00 PM.
You have been brooding for far longer than you thought.
You get up from your chair.
You leave the living room.

You are in your room.
You begin to feel tired.
You take off your clothes.
You put on nightwear.
You get into bed.
You turn off your light.
You try to fall asleep.

You fall asleep.

You dream of people you like.
You feel very happy.
You are in a state of euphoria.
You do not want this feeling to end.
You know it will.
This displeases you.
You awake in a sweat.
You leave your bed.
You leave your room.

You are in the kitchen.
You look at the food around you.
You become hungry.
You decide not to eat anything.
This is a pathetic attempt to lose weight.
You leave the kitchen.

You are in your room.
You enter your bed.
You turn off the light.

You fall asleep.

You did not have any more dreams.

You awaken.
Light is streaming through your curtains.
You look to your clock.
The time reads 6:00 AM.
It is a NEW DAY.
