It is a NEW DAY.
You are in your bed.
Your mother is not calling you.
You should probably still get out of bed.

You are still in bed.
You are very tired.
You have no motivation to leave bed.
You think about work.
You do not have work today.

You are still in bed.
It has been a number of minutes.
You pay attention to the SOUNDS around you.
You can hear a clock ticking downstairs.
You can hear CARS driving past your house.
You can hear the buzzing of ELECTRICITY.
You can hear your NEIGHBOUR mowing their LAWN.

You are still in bed.
It has been a number of minutes.
The sounds have stopped.
You listen attentively.
You can still hear a clock.
You grow suspicious of this clock.

You are still in bed.
The clock is displeasing you.
It does not tick at a steady rate.
Maybe you should get out of bed and look at it.
You open your EYES.

You are out of bed.
You decide to stay in your nightwear.
You leave your room.

You are in the living room.
This place haunts you at the moment.
You wish there was a light you could turn on.
There is no light.
The clock is here.
The clock is ticking.
You feel like the clock is getting louder.
You know that is not true.
It is just your imagination.
Your heart is beating very quickly.
Your heart is beating faster than the ticking of the clock.
You decide that this is normal.
You leave the living room.

You are in your HALLWAY.
There is not much here.
There is a FRONT DOOR.
There is a BASEMENT DOOR.
There is a BATHROOM DOOR.
You feel like you need to open one of these doors.
You decide against it.
For now.
You leave the hallway.

You are in the kitchen.
You begin to feel hungry.
Perhaps you should eat something other than cereal today.
You look for a FRUIT.
You find a PEACH.
Peaches are normally appetizing to you.
This peach is unappetizing.
You eat it anyways.

You are done eating the peach.
You are still hungry.
You leave the kitchen.

You are in a new hallway.
This hallway has five doors.
There are three BEDROOM DOORS.
One of these is yours.
There is one MASTER BEDROOM DOOR.
There is one bathroom door.
You decide it would be a good idea to use the bathroom.
You enter the bathroom.

You are in the bathroom.
You use the toilet.

You wash your hands.
You look at yourself in the mirror.
You are unappetizing.
This displeases you.
You try to make yourself look better.
You tidy your hair.
You wash your face.
You suck in your stomach.
You reposition your clothes.

You look worse.
You give up.
You leave the bathroom.

You are in your room.
You are still tired.
You enter your bed.
You try to get some unneeded rest.

You succeed.

You feel somewhat energized.
You have come to accept that your clock ticks irregularly.
You do not want to have to go into your living room again.
But you will not say that to anybody.
You are bored.
You want to read something.
You look to your bookshelf.
There is nothing of interest.
You take a book off the shelf.
The book is called "Hey There, Are You Okay?"
You were given this book as a gift.
You had recently done something that made someone give this book to you.
You remember what it was, and who it was. 
You do not like thinking about it.
You read the book.

The book has made you sad.
It made you remember BETTER TIMES.
You can not recall what exactly about these times were better.
Angered, you throw the book across your room.
You lie back down.
You stare at the CEILING.
The ceiling is flat.
The ceiling has many SHADOWS being cast upon it.
The shadows are moving.
This displeases you.
You leave your room.

You are in the kitchen.
Your mother enters through the front door.
She is now home.
You feel safe.
She asks you what you got up to today.
You do not say anything.
She asks you what is wrong.
You do not say anything.
Your mother has a sad look on her face.
She looks as though she is about to cry.
This displeases you.
You now have a sad look on your face.
You look as though you are about to cry.
You run back to your room.

You are in your room.
You are crying.
You are not sad.
Your mother's face made you feel a certain way.
You want to go to her.
You want to apologize to her.
You are afraid to do so.
Maybe she will come to you.

It has been a number of hours.
Your mother has not come to you.
This displeases you.
You feel guilty.
Perhaps you will live with this guilt for the rest of your life.
You do not want to think about that.
You go to your bed.
You decide against entering it.
You lie down on the floor next to it.
It is carpeted.
You quickly fall asleep.

You dream of your father.
You have mixed feelings about this.
Your father is very nice in your dreams.
He lends you his hand in your dream.
He tells you things that you want to hear in your dream.
You wish he was like that in real life.
You dream of your mother.
This displeases you.

It is a NEW DAY.
But you do not want to wake up just yet.
